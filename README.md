# 2048.NET

Just a tiny 2048 implementation as a .NET Console app, made because of reasons. Realtime animations and stuff for fun.

## How to run

### Build Locally

Requires .NET 8

```sh
cd net-2048
dotnet run
```

### In the browser

Deployed to [GH Pages](https://xorboo.github.io/net-2048/) automatically. Blazor code hacked up for fun and barely works, avoid at all costs.
